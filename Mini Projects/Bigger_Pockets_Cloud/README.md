# Bigger_Pockets_Cloud
**Project involves:** Data Scraping, Data Cleaning, Data Visualisation
**Python:** 3.7.6  
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, BeautifulSoup, wordcloud


## Purpose
To create an easy to understand visualisation of the topics covered by the Bigger Pockets podcast.  Doing so will help catch the eye of new possible listeners, as they will be able to get a grasp on the type of content Bigger Pockets produces before having to put forth time listening to an episode.  Loweing the barrier to entry, this should increase viewership, as they will not be "cold listening" when starting their first episode.
