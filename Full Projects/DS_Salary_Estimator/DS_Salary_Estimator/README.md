# Data Science Salary Estimator: Project Overview

* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $12k) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job

* Scraped over 1000 job descriptions using python and selenium

* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.

* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using RidsearchCV to reach the best model.

* Built a client facing API using flask.

# Web Scraping

Tweaked the web scraper github repo (above) to scrape 1000 job postings from glassdoor.com. With each job, we got the following:

* Job title
* Salary Estimate
* Job Description
* Rating
* Company
* Location
* Company Founded Date
* Type of Ownership
* Industry
* Sector
* Revenue

# Data Cleaning

After scraping the data, we needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our model.  We made the following changes and created the following variables:

* Parsed numeric data out of salary
* Made columns for employer provided salary and hourly wages
* Removed rows without salary
* Parsed rating out of company text
* Made a new column for company state
* Transformed founded date into age of company
* Made columns for if different skills were listed in the job description:
..* Python
..* R
..* Excel
..* AWS
..* Spark
* Column for simplified job title and Seniority
* Column for description length
* Column for minimum degree reqirement
