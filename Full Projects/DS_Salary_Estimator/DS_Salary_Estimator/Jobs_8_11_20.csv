Very few (if any!) people will fit every description; so if you are passionate about what this role entails, and are excited by solving real problems, we encourage you to apply; we want to learn about you, and what you can add to our team!

Who we are.
Root Insurance is the nation’s first licensed insurance carrier powered entirely by mobile. We were founded on the belief that the services you need for everyday life should serve you better. That’s why we base insurance coverages on you, not your demographic. It’s the way insurance should be. And it’s all conveniently in an app.

What draws people to Root.

We’re a venture-backed technology company. Our early success is in large part due to our unwavering standards in hiring. We recognize that our product is only as good as the people building and promoting it.

Problems stick in our craw, and we don’t let them go until we solve them. We believe in the scientific process and know that experimentation is the best way to find truth. We don’t hold ideas down no matter how crazy they may seem. We foster them, nurture them, and unceasingly test them. If you are the kind of person that loves tackling big problems with a collaborative group of people until you find solutions, you belong here.

Our passion and vision is to rapidly translate research discoveries into lasting treatment options for pediatric patients afflicted with Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors. Specifically, our laboratory is studying the mechanisms that potentiate low to high grade glioma progression. We use transgenic brain tumor mouse models that recapitulate low to high grade glioma progression and correlate our findings with peripheral blood and tumor specimens from patients with CNS tumors. These models also serve as a platform to explore the contribution of the tumor microenvironment and myeloid cells in low grade glioma progression and also test novel therapeutic agents aimed at impairing malignant transformation. Furthermore, modulating myeloid-derived cell population recruitment using JAK 1/2 Inhibitors prior to malignant tumor progression has shown translational promise.
While advances have demonstrated the importance of the microenvironment in various solid tumors, a critical knowledge gap exists with regards to understanding how myeloid cell heterogeneity and cross-talk with other immune cells plays a role in enhancing low grade glioma progression. To address this critical knowledge gap, our team is using a multi-disciplinary approach that leverages single cell sequencing and NGS along with cancer and molecular biology techniques to investigate the dynamic nature of the evolving immune microenvironment within gliomas.
Our long-term goals are to use these innovative tools in order to translate our findings into new age clinical trials for patients with gliomas and validate select myeloid cell populations as in-vivo biomarkers that may enhance risk stratification and targeted approaches for this patient population.
Ultimately, the passion and vision of the Rajappa Lab is to rapidly translate research discoveries into lasting treatment options for pediatric patients afflicted with CNS tumors. If you share this passion and vision, please send your CV, a cover letter, names of 3 references with contact information, and a one page statement of your research interests to Prajwal.Rajappa@nationwidechildrens.org

Job Description Summary

JOB SUMMARY: A staff resource assigned to perform a specific activity in support of an approved corporate program or project for a limited period of time. The hiring manager will create job expectations for each project position.

Job Description

RELATIONSHIP: Reporting relationships will be determined based on the needs of the assigned project.

AN EXPLANATION OF PROJECT STAFFING:

STAFFING: A ""project basis staffing"" is a job temporarily assigned in order to perform a specific activity in support of an approved corporate project. The assignment is typically two years or less. The limited life of this assignment distinguishes a ""project"" position from most other positions. Project staffing allows management a greater level of flexibility in selecting an incumbent with the needed level of expertise. Because of the truly temporary status of the project job, the need for specific skills, and a fair administration of compensation for project personnel, the project jobs are to be staffed on a lateral basis (i.e. the incumbent remains on the same pay band he/she held before project participation).

LENGTH OF ASSIGNMENT: The assignment is typically two years or less. However there are two types of project staffing assignments. A short-term assignment would normally be four months or less and would not involve a permanent transfer. Salary would be administered as normal, and the previous position would typically be held open. A long term project assignment would be longer than four months, could involve relocation, and the employee's previous position would be re-staffed or eliminated. Qualified associates will typically be provided 60 calendar days to search for a new position. For clarification, contact your local HR representative.

SALARY ADMINISTRATION: Individuals hired would typically receive a pro-rated merit increase. During the project, merit salary adjustments pursuant to the salary administration guidelines will be based on the employee's pay band at the time of placement on the project job. Performance evaluations will be conducted as they would on any job as appropriate.

END OF PROJECT: Prior to the end of the project, Human Resources will be notified by the Project Executive regarding the project completion date. Human Resources will assist the project job holder for a period of sixty calendar days, if qualified, in his/her search for a position . The success of the associate in securing a position is contingent upon prior related work experience, satisfactory performance on the project and the availability of open positions matching the associates? skills and experience. The associate is expected to compete for positions with other Nationwide associates and/or external applicants. There is no guarantee that the associate leaving the project will secure another position.

JOB REQUIREMENTS:

Vary based on project needs. Please refer to the On-Line Requisition System for a summary skills listing; the Project Executive can provide a detailed listing.

Values: Regularly and consistently demonstrates the Nationwide Values and Guiding Behaviors.

JOB CONDITIONS:

Overtime Eligibility: Not Eligible (Exempt).

Working Conditions: Normal office environment.

ADA: The above statements cover what are generally believed to be principal and essential functions of this job. Specific circumstances may allow or require some people assigned to the job to perform a somewhat different combination of duties.

Credit Check: AS APPLICABLE TO THE SPECIFIC PROJECT - Due to the fiduciary accountabilities within this job, a valid credit check and/or background check will be required as part of the selection process.",3.6,"Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company & Affiliated Companies
