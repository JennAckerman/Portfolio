## Background
Hello and welcome to my portfolio!

To give a little bit of background for myself; I attended and completed my Bachelors of Science degree at the Ohio State University, majoring in Economics.  During my time there, I completed classes in Statistics, Econometrics, Labor Economics, Game Theory and Economic History, where I fine tuned my passion for analytics and my skills to distinguish good data from bad data.  Some of the projects I worked through were: Census data of households surrounding Universities and their changes over time, Maple Syrup and it's correlation with divorces in Maine, and my favorite, The Agricultural Revolution and its causality of the Industrial Revolution.

Post-college, I focus my time on projects are more problem solving in nature, such as the Glassdoor Salary Estimator.
