## Background
Hello and welcome to my portfolio!

To give a little bit of background for myself; I attended and completed my Bachelors degree in Economics at the Ohio State University, with a focus in Econometrics.  During my time there, I completed classes in Statistics, Labor Economics, Game Theory, and Econometrics, where I fine tuned my passion for analytics and my skills to distinguish good from bad data.  Some of the projects I worked through were: Census data of households surrounding Universities and their changes over time, and my senior project (and also my favorite), The Agricultural Revolution and its causality upon the Industrial Revolution.

Post-college, I focus my time on projects are more problem solving in nature, such as the Glassdoor Salary Estimator.
