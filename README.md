## Background
Hello and welcome to my portfolio!

I am Jennifer Ackerman and currently I am completing my Masters Degree in Data Analytics at Franklin University and working as a Project Coordinator for Actalent Services.  I have 4 years of work experience in the Business Analyst and Data Analyst fields, ranging from building business requirements to data mapping to BI dashboards.  

Here I hold my projects from either my Masters degree, or personal projects that I have done outside of work.
